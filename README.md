# Health-Spending-and-Outcomes in USA vs OECD Countries

WHY USA HAS HIGH HEALTHCARE PER CAPITA SPENDING?

Introduction

The United States has the highest health expenditure as a percentage of GDP and per capita health expenditure compared with most industrialized countries. In the year 2017 USA national health expenditure (NHE) was 17.9% of U.S GDP (CMS 2018). The USA NHE is more than twice for the OECD average.  The U.S health expenditure is highest compared with other developed countries not only at aggregate level, but per service type expenditure is also higher compared with other industrial world countries.  Per capita spending by type of health care such as hospitals/nursing homes, ambulatory care (physicians, specialists, dentists, and so forth), pharmaceuticals and medical goods, and public health and administration is higher than in most countries in the OECD (OECD  2011). When we consider the health outcomes, USA performs better in technology intensive care such cancer treatment and acute hospital cares. However, generally USA health outcomes are relatively low compared with other economically advanced countries. 

Motivation

In US healthcare policy has been always controversial and debatable political issue since President Truman in 1930s to President Trump in 2018. Different policies were legislated that would expand or contract the health care expenditure. However, the US healthcare expenditure remained the highest in the world.  In addition, the national healthcare expenditure has kept increasing. The lower healthcare outcomes in US specially like: lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, a higher obesity rate, more potential life years lost, and a less developed primary healthcare are in paradox with high health spending the nation is investing in the sector.  This is the reason motivated me to use some available data and see what would explain the high healthcare expenditure in USA. 

President Truman proposed a universal healthcare plan in 1945; however, many American politicians and healthcare providers such as the American Medical Association and physicians opposed the idea and aggressively lobbied against the national health insurance bill by labeling it “socialized Medicine” (Markel 2014).  This policy diversion from the rest of world is one of the fundamental causes for the large difference between health expenditures in the US and the other industrialized countries. As a result, USA has multiple payer system, more share of private insurances and non-standardized charging and transaction formats.

The multiple payer system combined with non-standardized charging and transaction formats resulted in higher administration costs (Catlin and Cowan 2015). Furthermore, the health care market is less regulated than in other industrialized countries, which enables the providers of healthcare services to charge higher markup prices.  Some hospital in California cost more than fifteen times for similar treatments in other states. Generally, the factors contributing to high health expenditure in the U.S. can be categorized as price and non-price factors.This project evaluates both price related and non-price   factors that impact health expenditures in USA in comparison with countries in OECD.  

Data Sources

Hospital Price data is obtained from Kaiser FAmily Foundation Website, Hospital Charge to Cost ratio data is obtained from CMS.All other data are obtained from OECD Stats website. The Indicators used are not exhaustive. It is choisen  based on availability. 

Research Questions

-	Are healthcare services over consumed in USA compared with other countries?
-	Does USA have better quality of service?
-	How significant is Administration cost in USA compared with other countries?
-	Is USA Healthcare Priced higher compared with other Developed countries in OECD?
-	Are the healthcare Prices evenly distributed among states?

Methodology and Description of the App   

Descriptive analysis like plots, tables, and charts are used.  Health spending time serious data is used to show trend over time,
for health utilization different years are compared, and for all others the most recent available data are used.
The app mainly shows the following health spending and health outcome indicators.
Tab1: 1Health spending by categories are analyzed: per capita health spending , per capita pharmaceutical spending and percentage share of curative and rehabilitative care, preventive care and administration costs.
Tab2: Shows health resources availability indicators such as active physicians, number of MRI , number of CT scanners and hospital beds.
Tab3: shows healthcare utilization such as Doctors consultations, c-section, MRI exams and Breast Cancer Screening and Average Length of Stay for curative care. 
Tab4: Shows some healthcare quality indicators. Three of them are cost related indicators, one shows average waiting time to see specialist and the last indicator is having enough time with a doctor. These quality indicators are selected based on availability of data. There are other quality indicators mainly related to actual care results: cancer five year survivor rates. However, data is missing for most years and this limited the indicators used.
Tab5: shows average hospital prices for four procedures: appendoctomy , c-section, MRI exam, and normal delivery.
Tab6: shows average charge to cost ratio of hospitals by States in USA based on Diagonsis related groups(DRG).
Tab7: Shows lists of the top 100 Hospitals in USA with high charge to cost ratio(CCR).


Conclusion 

The indicators used are not exhuastive becuase of missing problems for some of thh years.Based on the indicators use in the project people in USA  are consuming relatively technology intensive healthcare services. USA healthcare doesn’t Look best in quality indicators considered in this project, except efficient in waiting times to see specialist.USA Healthcare prices are expensive and providers are charging  high markups. Administration of healthcare is costing a lot in USA compared with other developed countries.
